# Text Editor

## Your Task

Created a text editor that runs in the browser and provides users with creating, saving, and editing text. Built as a single page application that allows users to work within the browser or offline. 

## User Story

As a user, I want the ability to save and edit text within the browser, even when offline. Whether taking notes or code snippets, I seek a tool that can be accessed without an internet connection.
